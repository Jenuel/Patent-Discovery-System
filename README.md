# Patent Discovery System

Welcome to the Patent Discovery System repository! This project is an AI-powered patent search and analysis platform, designed to assist users in uncovering prior art, performing infringement/clearance tasks, and exploring patent landscapes.

The solution is divided into a frontend web application and a backend API server, supported heavily by advanced AI and search models (Google Gemini, OpenAI embeddings, Elasticsearch, Pinecone, and MongoDB).

## 📖 Documentation
Detailed documentation is available in the respective directories:
- 🚀 **[Backend Documentation](./apps/api/README.md)**: Explore the robust FastAPI application, dual-index hierarchical search strategy, installation instructions, and precise API specifications.
